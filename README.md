# VBEmu
Fork of the Virtual boy emulator from Mednafen/libretro.
This was done initially because i wanted to see if a console like the RG-350 could run it smoothly and it did after many changes.
Note that this only supports B & W palette, no 3D etc... This is for 2D only and those that just want to play the retail games as is.

I've ported it to OpenDingux platforms, Retrostone 2 and Funkey-S. I experimented with Classic MacOS but there are currently big endian only issues with it.
